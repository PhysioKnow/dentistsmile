<p> Here comes the International  <b>Yoga</b> day. So, what you all know about <b>Yoga?? </b> Let's understand the basic definition as below: </p>

<p><b>Yoga</b> is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. There is a broad variety of <b>Yoga</b> practices like hatha <b>Yoga</b> etc..Some <b>Yoga</b> teachers defined single line difference between <b>Yoga</b> and general excercise as <b>Yoga</b> to be practised slowly and gently whereas general excercise to be practiced quickly and with force.</p>

<p> I at <b>Physioknow</b> recommend daily <b>Yoga</b> excercises to keep calm mind and healthy physique.There are lot of general physiotherapy excercises which are similar to <b>Yoga</b> asnas, whereas in case of extreme pain and accidental related problems, I also provide excercises through different physio machines.</p>

<p>I am sure all <b>Physioknow</b> followers had enjoyed International <b>Yoga</b> day today and contributed their atleast 15-20 minutes of time by practicing different <b>Yoga</b> asnas.</p>

<p>I pray for all of you to have healthy and peaceful routine which is also full of knowledge towards healthy life.</p>

<p><b>I end today with below Quote: </b></p>

<p><i>"Simple smile every morning after you wake up and before you sleep, already gained you one extra healthy day for life " </i></p>

<p><b>Be healthy, Be happy !! and keep adding knowledge in your life</b></p>
